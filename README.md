# About Me

I'm Shady Nikooei, a Computer Engineering undergraduate student at Razi University, Iran, and a **Digital Image Processing enthusiast**.  
I focus on applied image and audio processing techniques, particularly in **digital image processing, feature extraction, and computer vision**.  

My main areas of interest and research include:

- Digital Image Processing  
- Internet of Things (IoT)  
- Improving algorithms for image retrieval and feature extraction  
- Computer Vision  
- Multimedia security and watermarking  

I also have experience in designing digital systems using Verilog, but my current focus is on improving image feature extraction algorithms and practical computer vision applications.
